We all have that one friend, or many friends, who know we are into crypto and investing, and they send constant questions. I personally have about half a dozen family members who ask me a crypto question daily. I usually do not mind answering questions, because I truly care about helping educate newcomers to the space, but it sure can be time consuming! I look forward to simply inviting everyone to join the Chummy Fin Club where they can ask all their questions, without fear of &#8220;sounding dumb&#8221;. The Chummy Fin Club is a safe place to give and get answers to any and all questions related to crypto, NFTs, and financial markets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community members can ask questions like: What\u2019s the best cold wallet? What are people hodling? What are people selling? I lost my secret phrase what do I do? (we\u2019ll answer this one here, don\u2019t ever lose your secret phrase or your crypto is gonzo!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Monthly Guest Speaker Series<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon launch, we will be hosting monthly AMAs, webinars, virtual sessions, and good old fashion in-person meetups with successful investors, industry thought leaders, and project founders. The goal of our monthly guest speaker series is to give Chummy NFT holders intimate and up close access to the brightest minds in the industry and to learn directly from expert investors and builders. Some of these events will be virtual, and some will be in person throughout the USA and the world. We will ensure that there will always be a virtual option for NFT holders to have guaranteed access to all events, no matter where they are in the world. Our special guest series is going to be lit! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chummy Fin Con<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to be our major yearly event. It will be like Bitcoin Miami, Art Basel, TechCrunch Disrupt, but built by and for Chummies. We will have keynote speakers, NFT &amp; crypto project booths, happy hours, breakout sessions, and celebrity special guests floating around and chummin&#8217; it up with the Chummies. NFT holders will get VIP access to the action, along with special perks and other VIP access. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tons and Tons of Giveaways<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We want every club member to have success beyond their wildest dreams, and we want to help them achieve this. So, we are going to be hosting tons of giveaways for Chummies to encourage you to work hard and play hard. Think professional prizes like tickets to the Bitcoin Conference, CES, and Blockchain New York. Think fun stuff like the Super Bowl, NBA playoffs, and vacations. The giveaways are going to be a lot of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The Fincubator &amp; Fund<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is a community of investors and entrepreneurs, and we are all about opportunities to invest in new things. Part of the community wallet will be allocated towards investments and\/or grants into startups or Web3 projects in our community. If you are a NFT holder, you will have the opportunity to apply to the Fincubator and pitch for a chance to secure funding for your startup or project. This is HUGE! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are planning the launch of the Fincubator Fund, where entrepreneurs can apply with their projects, ideas, and early-stage startups, and have the opportunity to pitch the Chummy investor community, and get the mentorship, resources, and funding needed to make their project a success. You must be a chummy holder to apply to the Fincubator and to be considered for funding opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an active investor or entrepreneur, or you are looking to educate yourself and become more knowledgeable on financial markets and investment strategies, then the Chummy Fin Club welcomes you with open fins.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/yfd4A65WMk\" href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/yfd4A65WMk\">Click here to join our Discord server<\/a> and get involved in the community!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>\u270c\ufe0f<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Chummy Fin Club is an exclusive community that offers NFT holders the following utility, perks, benefits, and rewards.

As a child of the 1980s, I grew up in the era of trading Nintendo cartridges, garage sale hunting to try and find Sega games that suburban moms were getting rid of after their kids went to college, and hunting through the sale rack at Babbage\u2019s (the original name for Game Stop prior to 1999) looking for something cheap and new-to-me, that I could buy with my allowance.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, the Internet came along, and pretty much destroyed the retail game sellers, as everything shifted to online gaming. Game Stop puttered along, but their stock price went nowhere but down. That is until January, 2021.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have probably heard all about the rise of the Game Stop stock price in early 2021. For full context you can read <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\">more here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The TL;DR version of the story is simply this\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A bunch of Wall St. hedge fund sharks and whale short sellers saw Game Stop as bait, a quick and easy target they could attack for a quick profit by shorting the stock. But what they neglected to realize was that the power of the retail investor, and the aggregated capital of the crowd, is far more powerful. The Internet came to the rescue, and started buying up Game Stop stock. It was a collective shout from the meme lords and Reddit gang, saying \u201chow dare you pick on Game Stop!\u201d What unfolded next was a meteoric rise in Game Stop\u2019s stock price. In a matter of weeks the stock price skyrocketed, ultimately topping out at $496 on January 28th, 2021. Just a year prior the stock was trading around $4 per share, and had been on a steady decline for years. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of writing this, Game Stop is trading around $130, and the company is making strategic plans for a comeback and rebirth in this new digital age.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The story doesn\u2019t stop there. Those same meme stock investors took their crowd power and did the same thing with AMC, the movie theater chain that has suffered a similar stock fate due to the pandemic, and consumers flocking to streaming movies.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What we didn\u2019t realize was actually taking place was the birth of Chummies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chummies represent the little guy investors. Chummies are little sharks. They are retail investors who scour the Internet for investment information, ask friends what they are buying, invest in alt-coins like $DOGE and $SHIB, and go long on investments they believe in. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Individually, Chummies are small-time investors - folks looking to better they personal financial situation and invest in things they care about. But together, with the full force of the crowd, they can move markets and make waves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is a place to learn about investing opportunities and strategies, ask questions from your peers, market experts, and finance thought leaders, and get reliable information and diverse points of view, all with the goal of helping you make the right decisions for yourself.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>NFT Holder Rewards &amp; Perks<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is an exclusive community that offers NFT holders the following:\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Access to Exclusive &amp; Private Discord Channels<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will create public Discord channels of course, and will always have public community channels.
