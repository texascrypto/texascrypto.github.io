As a child of the 1980s, I grew up in the era of trading Nintendo cartridges, garage sale hunting to try and find Sega games that suburban moms were getting rid of after their kids went to college, and hunting through the sale rack at Babbage\u2019s (the original name for Game Stop prior to 1999) looking for something cheap and new-to-me, that I could buy with my allowance.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, the Internet came along, and pretty much destroyed the retail game sellers, as everything shifted to online gaming. Game Stop puttered along, but their stock price went nowhere but down. That is until January, 2021.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have probably heard all about the rise of the Game Stop stock price in early 2021. For full context you can read <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\">more here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The TL;DR version of the story is simply this\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A bunch of Wall St. hedge fund sharks and whale short sellers saw Game Stop as bait, a quick and easy target they could attack for a quick profit by shorting the stock. But what they neglected to realize was that the power of the retail investor, and the aggregated capital of the crowd, is far more powerful. The Internet came to the rescue, and started buying up Game Stop stock. It was a collective shout from the meme lords and Reddit gang, saying \u201chow dare you pick on Game Stop!\u201d What unfolded next was a meteoric rise in Game Stop\u2019s stock price. In a matter of weeks the stock price skyrocketed, ultimately topping out at $496 on January 28th, 2021. Just a year prior the stock was trading around $4 per share, and had been on a steady decline for years. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of writing this, Game Stop is trading around $130, and the company is making strategic plans for a comeback and rebirth in this new digital age.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The story doesn\u2019t stop there. Those same meme stock investors took their crowd power and did the same thing with AMC, the movie theater chain that has suffered a similar stock fate due to the pandemic, and consumers flocking to streaming movies.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What we didn\u2019t realize was actually taking place was the birth of Chummies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chummies represent the little guy investors. Chummies are little sharks. They are retail investors who scour the Internet for investment information, ask friends what they are buying, invest in alt-coins like $DOGE and $SHIB, and go long on investments they believe in. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Individually, Chummies are small-time investors - folks looking to better they personal financial situation and invest in things they care about. But together, with the full force of the crowd, they can move markets and make waves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is a place to learn about investing opportunities and strategies, ask questions from your peers, market experts, and finance thought leaders, and get reliable information and diverse points of view, all with the goal of helping you make the right decisions for yourself.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>NFT Holder Rewards &amp; Perks<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is an exclusive community that offers NFT holders the following:\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Access to Exclusive &amp; Private Discord Channels<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will create public Discord channels of course, and will always have public community channels.
