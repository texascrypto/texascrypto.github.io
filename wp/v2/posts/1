As a child of the 1980s, I grew up in the era of trading Nintendo cartridges, garage sale hunting to try and find Sega games that suburban moms were getting rid of after their kids went to college, and hunting through the sale rack at Babbage\u2019s (the original name for GameStop prior to 1999) looking for something cheap and new-to-me, that I could buy with my allowance.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the Internet came along, and pretty much destroyed the retail game sellers, as everything shifted to online gaming. GameStop puttered along, but their stock price went nowhere but down. That is until January, 2021.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have probably heard all about the rise of the GameStop stock price in early 2021. For full context you can read <a data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\" href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/gamestop-timeline-closer-saga-upended-wall-street\/story?id=75617315\">more here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TL;DR version of the story is simply this\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bunch of Wall St. hedge fund sharks and whale short sellers saw GameStop as bait, a quick and easy target they could attack for a quick profit by shorting the stock. But what they neglected to realize was that the power of the retail investor, and the aggregated capital of the crowd, is far more powerful. The Internet came to the rescue, and started buying up Game Stop stock. It was a collective shout from the meme lords and Reddit gang, saying \u201chow dare you pick on GameStop!\u201d What unfolded next was a meteoric rise in GameStop\u2019s stock price. In a matter of weeks the stock price skyrocketed, ultimately topping out at $496 on January 28th, 2021. Just a year prior the stock was trading around $4 per share, and had been on a steady decline for years. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of writing this, GameStop is trading around $130, and the company is making strategic plans for a comeback and rebirth in this new digital age.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story doesn\u2019t stop there. Those same meme stock investors took their crowd power and did the same thing with AMC, the movie theater chain that has suffered a similar stock fate due to the pandemic, and consumers moving to streaming.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we didn\u2019t realize was actually taking place was the birth of Chummies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chummies represent the new generation of investors. Chummies are little sharks. They are typically retail investors who scour the Internet for investment information, ask friends what they are buying, invest in alt-coins like DOGE and SHIB, and go long on investments they actually believe in. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individually, Chummies are small-time investors &#8211; folks looking to better they personal financial situation and invest in things they care about. But together, with the full force of the crowd, they can move markets and make waves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is a place to learn about investing opportunities and strategies, ask questions from your peers, market experts, and financial thought leaders, and get reliable information and diverse points of view, all with the goal of helping you make the right decisions for <strong><em>yourself<\/em><\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>NFT Holder Rewards &amp; Perks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chummy Fin Club is an exclusive community that offers NFT holders the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Access to Exclusive &amp; Private Discord Channels<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We will create public Discord channels of course, and will always engage in public discourse. As soon as we conclude our initial NFT sale, we will start to publish exclusive content and create discussions in private Discord channels that are available only to NFT holders. This is a premium, highly curated, and exclusive community, for only the most serious investors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Daily Digest: News, Trends &amp; Updates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be daily curated and exclusively sourced content, pulled together by our market analysts, and curated by our community managers. The goal of the daily digest is to deliver to community members a clear market outlook for the day. What\u2019s trending? What are whales talking about? What\u2019s new? What\u2019s launching? We&#8217;ll also share updates and announcements for new projects and whitelist opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The daily digest will cut through the noise and keep you informed in one reliable place, so you don\u2019t have to toggle between dozens of sub-Reddits or group chats of questionable reliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If for no other reason, this will be worth holding an NFT alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Private Q&amp;A Discord Channel<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a safe place to ask the community and our expert partners, any and all questions that you have related to crypto, NFTs, and financial markets. We all have that one friend, or many friends, who know we are into crypto and investing, and they send constant questions. I personally have about half a dozen family members who ask me a crypto question daily. I usually do not mind answering questions, because I truly care about helping educate newcomers to the space, but it sure can be time consuming! I look forward to simply inviting everyone to join the Chummy Fin Club where they can ask all their questions, without fear of &#8220;sounding dumb&#8221;. The Chummy Fin Club is a safe place to give and get answers to any and all questions related to crypto, NFTs, and financial markets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community members can ask questions like: What\u2019s the best cold wallet? What are people hodling? What are people selling? I lost my secret phrase what do I do? (we\u2019ll answer this one here, don\u2019t ever lose your secret phrase or your crypto is gonzo!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Special Guest Event Series<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are planning on doing monthly AMAs, and meetups with successful investors and industry thought leaders, to give NFT holders intimate and up close access to the brightest minds in the industry. Some of these events will be virtual, and some will be in person throughout the USA and the world. We will ensure that there will always be a virtual option for NFT holders to have guaranteed access to all events, no matter where they are in the world. Our special guest series is going to be lit! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chummy Fin Con<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to be our major yearly event. It will be like Bitcoin Miami, Art Basel, TechCrunch Disrupt, but built by and for Chummies. We will have keynote speakers, NFT &amp; crypto project booths, happy hours, breakout sessions, and celebrity special guests floating around and chummin&#8217; it up with the Chummies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT holders will get VIP access to the action, along with special perks and opportunities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tons and Tons of Giveaways<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This project is all about the community, and all about helping our community members crush it, while have fun doing so. We\u2019ll be giving away event tickets to exciting industry events, and other fun things like concerts, the Super Bowl, NHL playoffs, vacations, and even airdropping crypto and NFTs from time to time. NFT holders will have a chance to win giveaways simply by holding an NFT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the Chummy Fin Club in a nutshell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an active investor, or you are looking to educate yourself and become more knowledgeable on financial markets and investment strategies, then the Chummy Fin Club welcomes you with open fins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/yfd4A65WMk\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/yfd4A65WMk\">Click here to join our Discord server<\/a> and get involved in the community!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peace,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punk Chummy<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First off, welcome to the Chummy Fin Club!
