Immediately, it made sense to me. NFTs represent the future of value storage and ownership. I\u2019m in a continual state of learning, when it comes to the crypto and NFT space. I\u2019m bullish, but I know I still have a lot to learn. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working on this project. It is a community that I want for myself - a place to ask questions, learn from experts, get sound market information, and grow.\u201d<\/em><\/p><cite>- Rafael Simpson<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":100790,\"width\":200,\"height\":200,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/chummyfinclub.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Josh-Norman-260-\u00d7-260-px.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-100790\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"\/><figcaption><strong>Josh Norman<\/strong> \/\/ Sensei 'NO,#9985 \/\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/J_No24\">Twitter<\/a> \/\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jno24\/\">Instagram<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Josh Norman is an American football cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL.
